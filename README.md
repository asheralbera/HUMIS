# Humis Project
## By Asher Albera

Working on this project was a completely new learning experience, as I'm usually used to start on basic content and build on it.
However, starting the class with real-life examples of what HTML and CSS can look like in a career. Having access to all of these tags and CSS 
*"settings"* right away allowed me see how a website can be built. 

I particularly appreciated the recommendation of creating building blocks and use borders too physically see how the content can be shaped into different 
boxes. When I had previously used HTML in a different course, I really struggled to manage things like navigation and separating content into sections without
being able to really see how the page would be set up. 

As someone who is interested in UX and technical writing, it is very likely that I will come across HTML and CSS quite often, so this was definitely a really good introduction 
to the topic, which I'm excited to get back to at the end of the semester.
