/*div can be used in a way that everything inside of the div tag (which can have multiple
things in it) is going to have the same style - careful cause this can create overlaps
    putting an ID like #name you can specify what kind of div tag has what kind of
    style, you then use the # in the code when you open the div -- <div id="parent">

     you also have classes - using .

     you can use classes multiple times thorughout a page, IDs are only used once per page


     with CSS if you make a style for body, but you want it different for nav, you can over
     ride styles on a child of the parent tag with the original one.
